Should be a REST bridge to mega:

	- Should set a 'root' customizable root like /Root/Storage123/ 
	- No auth neccecary, for internal use.
	- No thumbnails need to be generated
	- Should cache mega sessions

1. To upload a file:

PUT http://proxy/foo/bar.jpg

Uploads to /Root/Storage123/foo/bar.jpg, optionally creates directories if needed.


2. To download a file:

GET http://proxy/foo/bar.jpg

Streaming if possible/practical. Local caching is nice.


3. To get directory listing:

GET http://proxy/foo/

Lists files/directories
